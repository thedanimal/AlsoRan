This program doesn't do anything right now.

The goal is to make this program become an Android app that is focused on running. It might do something like a [Pace Calculator](https://github.com/thedanimal/PaceConverter/wiki) or [Miles In My Shoes](https://github.com/thedanimal/MilesInMyShoes/wiki).

It might do a whole lot more. It might do only one thing but do it well.
